# Bus-ticketing-system-using-Android

Hello Developers,
      This is my final year project where we have developed a new E-ticketing system for public transport. We have developed 2 android applicatioins and 1 web application to analyse the crowd data. Using android app customer can book tickets from home and manage e-wallet as well as track busses. The web application is for the admin to add new busses, re-route the busses during traffic and also analyse the crowd data and generate a bar graph.
      We have used java programming language to develop android apps and used MySql for database management. I have also attached project report which was documented using sharelatex.
      
      
      Keep coding, Keep sharing!!!
